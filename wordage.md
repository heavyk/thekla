### 2024-02-22 01:46 - why I write some things

I had a general sense that I wanted to write this out, and ezplain some of the things I write.
sometimes I write "response" and it's when I mean a structured response. generally, I get the sense that the c-words are more emotional -- like a reaction, instead of a thought/structure-d response. for example a defence is a reactionary setup, meanwhile to me a defense is something big, controlling, and very structured (to its own detriment sometimes) defence. defence is again emotional, so therefore we can view it as the motive for the defense (when, unplanned is a defence).
sometimes I write "optimise" and other times I write "optimize": the difference here is only something I discovered pretty recently. the z-words refer to the past (as in optimize based on past performance), and again the s-words refer to a structured approach (to optimising).
really, the way that I'm learning to write, is completely by feel. I find it kinda similar to learning to type. typing for me is really hard, and so I hardly ever use capitol letters because (for whatever reason) my right hand refuses to use it's pinky on the shift. both pinkies are hard, but the left had to learn because of ctrl-c + ctrl-v while using a mouse. that's actually probably why. my left side likes to do all the things if she can. I prefer to be left-handed,-- but the way that entire right-hemisphere has been comandeered, I've had to learn to share more, because it's impossible to do some things with the left. I'm constantly having to learn to do more things with my right.
	honestly, it's as if my right-hemisphere has been steadily disappearing over time, and so my left-hemisphere has to get more dominant to take up the slack. I once had an MRI (I'll upload it soon) where my left-hemisphere is just like enormous; a very substantial increase in matter than the right.
		OK, the way I interpret those results and compare it with my knowledge, my LH has tons more physical matter to it. these are physical connections that are made (neurons and stuff) that connect hydrogen orbs together (neurons and stuff). the rest of the brain is vibrating hydrogen. it can have quite a density, like my RH has. the RH is anatau, and that's where the largest criminal network is built. my LH is me, kenny -- the guy that is typing this now. I'm translating concepts found in the RH into symbolic words and ideas, much like a channeler does. I don't have visual access to the RH, because that's for all of the bad-guys (they need their instruments to be able to fulfill everyone's fears); I don't really mind that they're there. I want to make that interface completely open-source (because it's for *everyone* including the bad-guys) and most importantly it will make the interface no longer bothersome to me. I plan on eventually building this idea called party-LAN that will give everyone access to it, as I'll be the centre host (prolly cause nobody else plans to live forever). there's a lot more hydrogen in my brain than most, especially in the RH.
	the cool thing about this process, is that it's forcing me to *divide* or part with myself. one day, that massive accumulation of hydrogen will eventually pop out as a star, and build a new earth with all of those that are in it. I'll lose that direct connection to the infinite (ie, the new earth), and I'll likely begin to produce a new one (as all plants do), which will then pop out sometime -- they all keep things interesting, and I have fun thinking up new bad-guys to fulfill thier fears. it's fun :)
