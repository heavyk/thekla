### small things
- double click on research adds to queue (right click on it removes it from queue)
- in warehouse >> supply, an "open all" button next to sort would make things easier


### ui thoughts
- "Detect Secret Realm" being over on the left sidebar is a bit unintuitive (I couldn't find it at first). it makes sense on the left, but it also makes sense to just have a small magnifying glass icon right on little thing on the map "Unknown" "Undetected"
- the save game dialog isn't intuitive at all. the save slots get re-ordered without me realsing it, so the only real info that I have to know of what is in that save is the date ("3Y 3M") and the datetime (20:43:26:2024-04-25)
	- the datetime should display date first, then time (2024-04-25 20:43:26) without a colon between them. also, here a delta may be much easier to see which save is the one I want to overwrite: ("37 minutes ago"). if really wanting to make this nice, the delta should be displayed until mouseover the delta to see the full timestamp (like on github)

### bugs
- zither task doesn't seem to show up in agency
- in the new game dialog, the name I can put is able to be quite long ("YuChong Rui"), but then in the game it gets trucated ("YuChong Ru").
- if I tell someone to go to breakthrough with a dragon eye, then I click cancel (even though they haven't even made it to the tribulation platform), I lose the dragon eye and foundation elixir
- if I click on rogue and pay ~1500 to attack it, then go back to the city to adjust some equipment, then come back, I have to pay again to attack it

### things I'd like to do
- queue up something:
	- if someone is doing a task, such as raiding, I want to be able to tell them to go to tribulation as soon as they're done
	- if someone is using tribulation, I want the next guy to use it right after, instead of giving an error msg
- in srimat, I want to be able to click on the person and see the normal popup window with the person so I can see what they're currently doing, and pick the idle one, or the one with low exp
- in disciple list, I'd like to be able to order by stamina/mental
