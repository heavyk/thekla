### 2024-02-23 01:49 - I have a lot to say

yesterday, Ifelt the desire to write to you. originally, I was going to upload a bunch of puzzle solutions that I found in the-witness which I believe are valid solutions. however, I felt bad about that approach because I don't want to start off the relationship by telling you you're wrong or that something you did should be better. that would be a reflection of you, and often times me being a reflection of someone is more harmful than helpful. so, I wanted to do things different.
earlier yesterday, I was thinking about instead of trying to get your attention, instead of with a "no" -- but with a joke [weird, I feel slightly like a parent trying to manipulate a child to respond to me when I write that]. I came up with the joke that I would send to you: I was going to write you a full promo piece called "safety driven development" and then just make up a bunch of jokes about how we need even more levels of abstraction, to ensure that *nobody* can understand the code (and therefore have a chance to break it). the idea was: if the compiler can compile it, then it'll work, but good luck getting it to even compile. I was going to demonstrate with a "safe" hello world example, but it ended up going *waaay* different than I thought.
	you see, [the thing I wrote yesterday](/safety-driven-development.md) was actually a combination of a few different ideas: I personally really struggle with C++, cause I just don't quite see at a glance what the code is doing, whereas with other code (like VB6 or js), I can often see what's happening a lot quicker -- but that's still too slow. what I'd like is a kids language that runs as fast as C++. I know it's possible, but nobody ever seems interested in making their abstractions *easier* to use. for example, I know that it's possible to build up a whole 3d model using only blocks -- then the not-visible blocks can be simplified or optimised out. I want something like that, but presently there's no way to work only on the outer layer of the code and not worry about what's on the inside. over time, as I reveal more of my many ideas, the outside/inside allusion will be more apparent. I think visually, and for me, there are all kinds of blocks in the code that input/output things -- so all I do is just connect the things to each other, then to the program's human/hardware interface (that's it). then, I want the stuff not connected to the interface (ie, all of the stuff on the inside) to be moved around to optimal positions (you don't have your lungs behind your ears, cause it's a long way to the heart from there) and the unecessary stuff discarded. inotherwords, my brain thinks like a microprocessor, and (as ironic as it sounds), there's no way (that I know of) to replicate a microprocessor design (using 2/3 dimensions) in a symbolic system (which is linear/sequential).
	I've noticed that most commonly the "unsafe" things in sequential code, usually seem to be the stuff that tries to break the 1d barrier, so I decided that I wanted to try tackling that problem. funnily enough, I had left open the V programming language on my browser, and that language explicitly marks everything which can produce undefined behaviour with a `unsafe { ... }` notation to alert the programmer that could be the source of undefined behaviour. so when I looked at the [2048 example](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/examples/2048/2048.v), I didn't find any 1d breakers, but instead unsafe was for uninitialised memory (which is defined behaviour IMO: the compiler only needs to ensure write before read), and an enum being coerced to int. it seemed really silly to me that they're writing `unsafe` around things that I consider very normal stuff: it'd have to be a very large enum to overflow a u4, so why not just make coersion to i4 the default and make unsafe the coersion to u4 (or whatever)? it just seemed to me there should be an easier way to do it like an `enum2Int` which automatically returns a i/u 1/2/4/8 taking into account both the enum and also the recipient variable -- and now it's fully safe (easy peasy).
so what I think I'd like to do tonight is, instead of writing about the-witness just yet, I think I'm gonna go eat some more weed again, and try to write another joke. bye for now...

#### 2024-02-23 03:13 - temporally aware compiler

in the example of uninitialised memory being an unsafe operation, the obvious solution to this is to have the compiler ensure that the memory is written to before being read. however, such a feat is quite difficult with compilers today because it's difficult to know what will get called in what order. to study this example, let's assume that there are only a few entrypoints to the program (3-4 functions/buttons which can be called/pushed). once we have the full knowlege of all the starting positions, every possible branch is comes "later" in time.
	so, for example, if my button is going to read from the memory, and it's showing before the init code is run (which does the unsafe operation of allocating), then that's a problem. it should automatically produce an error saying that memory can be read/written before it's initialised. the obvious solution is to ensure the button is not even shown until after initialisation.
the difficulty with this approach is that the interface completely determines how the compiler will "see" the program -- and the problem with that is that interface-first development is not common. something that is available to the user will always have defined behaviour, because the moment it becomes available, it becomes a part of the interface (and so is therefore an entrypoint).

### 2024-03-06 11:22 - withholding of technology

hey, so I've been thinking about you a lot lately, and it's quite possible I'll put this repo up on github soon. before I do that though, I wanted to get this thought out. when I watched your stream a few years back (in fact it's been 5 years since I've seen you until I opened your youtube just now to see how long it's been), I remember you used to complain a lot about how innovation in technology has come to a stand-still. I say the same thing as you do, and see the effect in more places than just technology, like space travel, and interfaces to computers. I am certain that there's a lot that's being withheld from a lot of people. I see evidences of it all the time, from people interfacing with something visual inside of their eyes (using only their thoughts to direct it -- they look like they're daydreaming or spacing out: looking toward the distance, but at something right in front of thier eyes), to other things like mike pall for example repeatedly gives directions to be cautious of using the FFI feature of LuaJIT when calling windows functions -- but since I've never seen such code, it must only exist inside of his computer. though some things are open source, there seems to be a whole lot of power users which seem to have a much more efficient way of using their computer than is available to the public. you're a weirdo though, because you insist on using the most un-power tool of them all emacs, and still switches over to the terminal to compile (which is why I'm writing to you about it instead of mike -- for him I only have good ideas on how to improve LuaJIT).
I only referenced two examples there, but the amount of evidence that there are users which have much more rapid interfaces to their computer is astounding, and along with those people seems to come this secret world where the public is told all kinds of things that are simply not true. inotherwords, there seems to be levels to who has access to what interfaces and what kinds of conditions, and those levels seem to be the source of the witholding of technology.
	I did my own research into these levels of symbolic systems which better connect the brain to the computer, and it seems that the entire thing is governed by what I call the "saturnian-system". let me paint that picture: the two main perpetrators are the tops and the bottoms. both of them want to have a superior setup to the others, and so therefore do their best to try and keep everyone else with the older/outdated technology. a really good example of this is "google glass" -- a technology that projects an image on to a screen in front of the eye. it was super-cool state-of-the-art technology that everyone wanted, when all of a sudden in ~2016, google just sells their super cool tech off to china (america's enemy at the time). around the same time I noticed that others are now able to see what I see, and there's this thing called "pantalla retina" (I think) -- and these spanish dudes were talking about how this technology could record what is seen in the eyes and they'd talk about jerking off to some really awesome sex thing. I called this technology "nosebook" because when I looked into it, I noticed that it was really weird to see someone else's nose. I also noticed a stream you did ~2017 where you were complaining about bad interfaces and how they're all over the place -- the video cuts out and you resume talking about something else -- of which I can only imagine the cut out part, you're talking about the interface that you're now unable to get away from because it's inside of your eyes (ie, nosebook). a long time ago, I figured that this technology has to be coming from the US military because of the selling of outdated arms/technology to weaker factions (ie, google selling glass to china because they now have a superior system) -- but since then I've come to realise that the US govt is owned by private entities nowadays, and that google is essentially the technological aspect of the govt -- so it's not that. looking into it further, I noticed that the clearance levels go all the way to antarctica and the magnificent number of "tops" that come out of the system that hitler put into place at the end of WW2 (I call this system the "saturnian-system").
those levels of symbolic access to the brain/body and its interface to the computer seems to be the source of the witholding of technology... what's happening is the typical thing that happens in the saturnian-system: one guy does not want the other guy to have the technology, so he uses his top-powers to rearrange things so that the other guy is held away from the innovative technology. the thing is, the way that system works is that any modifications that are done there don't really have a lasting effect because the "destiny" at the end of time (ie, when the saturnian-system collapses) is already set. the end of the system *will* happen, and everything will fall apart (no spoilers, oops), and so they're just adjusting their temporal trajectory in relation to their perceived *now* -- which looks like a curve/spline where one end-point is anchored, and these guys are fighting endlessly over adding/moving/changing the many other control points preceding the end-point -- so what's happening is they're just kicking the can down the road, trying to keep as much perceived superiority before the coming end (or singularity) when it all falls apart and that kind of technology becomes available to everyone.
I personally am of the opinion that I want everyone to have continually improving access to thier mind and body (just like I have), and so for me a symbolic interface like they have, (turns out) is *NOT* what I want. I've come to really value chaos and imprecision. I'm not one of those speed-demon, neo types (my head runs very slowly, and so I'm meditating longer on each thought), which is why I suggested [a non-symbolic interface to the computer](/chaos-machines.md#2024-03-05-0958---bad-memory-forgitfulness-is-good) yesterday. my view is that technology (like myself) is designed to give us more and more of what we want, and so this interim period technology (of which I'm certain the saturnian-system is built upon) will continue to give them what they want (which is for the symbolic technology to be withheld from us), a new set of systems which are not exact and precise (think AI vs symbolic code) will start to emerge. I envision everything from compilers to interfaces, continually getting better at giving better results. I have many ideas on that which I'll begin to elaborate on here, because techology can easily pivot away from symbolic perfection and get into the grey area of "only improvements".
I'll continue these ideas more later; I just wanted to take the time and do a "full disclosure" of my intentions (though that's not possible) and to point out that the problem of stagnation of technology is only really happening in the symbolic/defined areas, and it's because of a self-imposed reflection of those that are doling out technology: they want to be held down by someone wants to be more higher/powerful/top/superior to someone else (be a have-not), and have to make deals to get the desired technology from those with it (the haves). they are the-problem and also the-solution: I say let them have thier symbolic turf, and just go a different way; let them duke it out endlessly until the end of time :) peace
