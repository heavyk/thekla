### 2024-02-23 01:49 - I have a lot to say

yesterday, Ifelt the desire to write to you. originally, I was going to upload a bunch of puzzle solutions that I found in the-witness which I believe are valid solutions. however, I felt bad about that approach because I don't want to start off the relationship by telling you you're wrong or that something you did should be better. that would be a reflection of you, and often times me being a reflection of someone is more harmful than helpful. so, I wanted to do things different.
earlier yesterday, I was thinking about instead of trying to get your attention, instead of with a "no" -- but with a joke [weird, I fell slightly like a parent trying to get a child to respond when I write that]. I came up with the joke that I would send to you: I was going to write you a full promo piece called "safety driven development" and then just make up a bunch of jokes about how we need even more levels of abstraction, to ensure that nobody can understand the code (and therefore have a chance to break it). the idea was: if the compiler can compile it, then it'll work, but good luck getting it to even compile. I was going to demonstrate with a "safe" hello world example, but it ended up going *waaay* different than I thought.
	you see, [the thing I wrote yesterday](/safety-driven-development.md) was actually a combination of a few different ideas: I personally really struggle with C++, cause I just don't quite see at a glance what the code is doing, whereas with other code (like VB6 or js), I can often see what's happening a lot quicker -- but that's still too slow. what I'd like is a kids language that runs as fast as C++. I know it's possible, but nobody ever seems interested in making their abstractions *easier* to use. for example, I know that it's possible to build up a whole 3d model using only blocks -- then the not-visible blocks can be simplified or optimised out. I want something like that, but presently there's no way to work only on the outer layer of the code and not worry about what's on the inside. over time, as I reveal more of my many ideas, the outside/inside allusion will be more apparent. I think visually, and for me, there are all kinds of blocks in the code that input/output things -- so all I do is just connect the things to each other, then to the program's human/hardware interface (that's it). then, I want the stuff not connected to the interface (ie, all of the stuff on the inside) to be moved around to optimal positions (you don't have your lungs behind your ears, cause it's a long way to the heart from there) and the unecessary stuff discarded. inotherwords, my brain thinks like a microprocessor, and (as ironic as it sounds), there's no way (that I know of) to replicate a microprocessor design (using 2/3 dimensions) in a symbolic system (which is linear/sequential).
	I've noticed that most commonly the "unsafe" things in sequential code, usually seem to be the stuff that tries to break the 1d barrier, so I decided that I wanted to try tackling that problem. funnily enough, I had left open the V programming language on my browser, and that language explicitly marks everything which can produce undefined behaviour with a `unsafe { ... }` notation to alert the programmer that could be the source of undefined behaviour. so when I looked at the [2048 example](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/examples/2048/2048.v), I didn't find any 1d breakers, but instead unsafe was for uninitialised memory (which is defined behaviour IMO), and an enum being coerced to int. it seemed really silly to me that they're writing `unsafe` around things that I consider very normal stuff: it'd have to be a very large enum to overflow a u4, so why not just make coersion to i4 the default and make unsafe the coersion to u4 (or whatever)? it just seemed to me there should be an easier way to do it like an `enum2Int` which automatically returns a i/u 1/2/4/8 taking into account both the enum and also the recipient variable -- and now it's fully safe (easy peasy).
so what I think I'd like to do tonight is, instead of writing about the-witness just yet, I think I'm gonna go eat some more weed again, and try to write another joke. bye for now...
